    "The link between brain function and computation goes back to the invention of the computer. From a modern perspective, we often think about the brain being a computer, but from Turing and Von Neumann's point of view, the computer was a brain! As they developed the architecture of the modern computer, their explicit goal was to make a machine that can do the mathematical calculations that they were doing inside of their heads. The computer was built to do what the brain does!\n",
