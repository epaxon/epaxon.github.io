# ## Points in high-dimensional space
# 
# Lets talk about data.
# 
# When we acquire data, we mathematically describe this data with vectors. The length of the vector is the dimensionality. The values of each vector element can be considered as a point in a high-dimensional space. 
# 
# If we have only 2-dimensional vectors we can plot them and visualize them. 
# 
# Classification attempts to divide up the space into classes. 
# 
# When we have data structured in formats such as matrices or tensors, we can usually turn them into vectors. For instance, an $NxMx3$ RGB image can just be rastered into an $N*M*3$ length vector.
