    "When I started my Ph.D. in neuroscience, I became very excited about imaging for recording large-scale neural activity. In my thesis lab, I had even more of an opportunity to pioneer techniques in voltage-sensitive dye imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of my contributions to the field were the development of algorithms and data analysis pipelines for making sense of the large-scale recordings. These were packaged up into analysis software, which was particularly useful for my thesis, allowing one to perform analysis on the imaging data quickly enough to use the results to guide follow-up experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since my thesis, I have continued to work with several groups performing large-scale neuroscience imaging experiments, providing the algorithms and data analysis pipelines for their imaging data. Modern neuroscience is very exciting with the ability to record more and more neurons, but there are still many computational and statistical analysis issues to overcome to make sense of this data."

    "\n",
    "For my Ph.D. thesis, I used electrophysiology and voltage-sensitive dye imaging to monitor the activity of dozens of neurons in the leech ganglion while they executed various behaviors. The activity elicited during these behaviors could then be simplified into functional features, such as the phase at which a neuron oscillates during the swim behavior. By combining functional and anatomical features, homologous neurons can be identified across different animals. With this approach we identified dozens of new neurons in the leech ganglion, and built an atlas of the canonical neurons that participate in different leech behaviors. \n",

    "The traditional saliency map model of human visual attention uses low-level visual features to attempt to predict fixational eye-movements. In this study, we showed participants images with faces, text and cell-phones to assess whether there are high-order visual features that are more salient than our models would predict. Based on the time it takes for the first fixational eye-movement to be executed, we showed that faces and text are both particularly salient and particularly fast compared to the controls and cell-phones. This suggests that some higher-order features are relevant in the bottum-up computation of the saliency map.\n",
